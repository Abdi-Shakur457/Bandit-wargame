Commands Ive used in this level : base64 , base64 -d data.txt , man base64 
This level I have come accross a new command so I have used the man command to explain what base64 was which is a command that encodes information in a file from txt to an unreadable gibberish text. After having a read I discovered if I use -d with the base64 command it decodes the txt back to its orginal format doing this it displayed the password to the next level.
